## Further ideas:

Although this is just a todo app wich functions like a todo app, I'm
considering add a hidden narrative into it. Yes, I will add more hidden
interaction to enable the user to really communicate with the
Coulittleson character. Even though 99% percent of the user will believe
this is just a todo app, there will be someone who try to do weird things,
and this is my inspiration. What if the todo task input box is actually a
chat box with Coulittleson? Why is he always there? Who is he? Can we
eventually free Coulittleson from his work? I think I can add more depth
to this project afterwards by packaging a hidden narrative game into it.
